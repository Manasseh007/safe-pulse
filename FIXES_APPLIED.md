# Django Project Fixes Applied

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. Missing Imports in authentication/urls.py
- **Problem**: `SecurityCompanyRegisterView` and `SecurityCompanyLoginView` were referenced but not imported
- **Fix**: Added proper imports from `iprotect.views`

### 2. Missing Function in authentication/views.py
- **Problem**: `test_auth` function was referenced in URLs but didn't exist
- **Fix**: Created the missing `test_auth` function

### 3. Import and Dependency Issues in iprotect/views.py
- **Problem**: Missing `status` import and conflicting serializer imports
- **Fix**: Added `rest_framework.status` import and cleaned up duplicate imports
- **Problem**: Duplicate `SecurityCompanyRegisterView` class definition
- **Fix**: Removed the duplicate class

### 4. Serializer Field Mismatches
- **Problem**: `SecurityCompanyRegisterSerializer` and `SecurityCompanyLoginSerializer` had incorrect field names
- **Fix**: Updated serializers to match actual model fields (username instead of email)

### 5. Model Field Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: `EmergencyAlert` model had inconsistent field names used in views
- **Fix**: Updated model to use `user_phone`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `created_at`, `is_resolved`

### 6. GDAL/GIS Dependencies
- **Problem**: Project tried to use Django GIS features without GDAL installed
- **Fix**: Removed all GIS-related imports and simplified location handling
- **Fix**: Removed GDAL configuration from settings.py

### 7. Database Migration Issues
- **Problem**: Existing migrations conflicted with model changes
- **Fix**: Deleted old migrations and created fresh ones

## Dependencies Installed:
- Django 5.2.2
- Django REST Framework 3.15.2
- (Twilio and requests ready to install when needed)

## Current Status:
✅ Django project loads without errors
✅ Database migrations applied successfully
✅ All URL patterns resolve correctly
✅ Models and serializers are properly configured
✅ Ready to run with `python manage.py runserver`

## Next Steps:
1. Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the development server
2. Install Twilio (`pip install twilio`) when SMS functionality is needed
3. Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
4. Test API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl

## Available API Endpoints:
- `/admin/` - Django admin interface
- `/api/auth/signup/` - User registration
- `/api/auth/login/` - User login
- `/api/send-emergency/` - Emergency SMS API
- `/api/security-company/login/` - Security company login
- `/api/security-company/register/` - Security company registration
- `/api/security-company/alerts/` - Security alerts
- `/auth/` - Authentication test endpoint
